Forked from https://github.com/kyos0109/nginx-distroless/ and updated to latest build with Debian Bullseye base image.

Given the number of security issues flagged by Trivy, Snyk and Anchore about the distroless base image, it is best to NOT use this image and use my [nginx](https://hub.docker.com/r/jauderho/nginx/) image instead.
